    "*Does the programming language in which a program is written affect software quality?* This is the driving research question you will study in this exam. In this context, we quantify software quality as number of bugs; the more bugs the lower the quality. In the software engineering world, there are many beliefs (or stereotypes) regarding the propensity to introduce bugs depending on the programming language in which the program is written. For instance, a common belief is that functional languages help programmers to not  introduce bugs. Furthermore, there exist other factors that may influence the amount of bugs in a piece of software. In the context of open source projects, it seems plausible that older projects will have more reported bugs---e.g., one would expect a 10 year old project to have more bugs than a 1 month old project.\n"

    "    \n",
    "* **H1** - Haskell code is less prone to contain bugs (B). In other words, the distribution on the number of bugs (B) for Haskell gives high probability to the lowest number of bugs among all programming languages (L).\n",
